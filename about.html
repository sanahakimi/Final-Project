	  <h1 style="width:100%; color:#fff;font-size:22px;text-align:center;" >Timothy Donald Cook (born November 1, 1960)[1] is an American business executive who is the current chief executive officer of Apple Inc. Cook had previously been the company's chief operating officer under its co-founder Steve Jobs.[2] Cook joined Apple in March 1998 as a senior vice president for worldwide operations, and then as vice president for worldwide sales and operations.[3] He was appointed chief executive on August 24, 2011, after Jobs, who had cancer and died later that year, resigned.[4]</h1>
      <h1 style="width:100%; color:#fff;font-size:23px;text-align:center;">During his tenure as the chief executive of Apple and while serving on its board of directors, he has advocated for the political reform of international and domestic surveillance, cybersecurity, national manufacturing, and environmental preservation. Since becoming CEO, Cook has also replaced Jobs's micromanagement with a more liberal style and implemented a collaborative culture at Apple.[5]: 314 [6]</h1>
